# Original Files 

Craig Miller at the Utah Division of Water Resources handed these folders to Adel Abdallah on a CD on June 16, 2015

## The purpose?
Craig Miller mentioned these reaons for loading their text files into a database
"at present we have flat files that only have at most 5 digits of accuracy.
In models we cannot see changes in systems like the Colorado River from small
changes upstream because we just don't have enough accuracy in our data
**We would also like to have a way of accessing data from different sources
through one data hub.**   
We want to be able to standardize how we keep our data.  
We also would like to be able to query our data for quick analysis."
